# Technical Test

Thank you for giving me the chance to prove myself with this technical test. I had hoped to get it working by the weekend. But it seems I have overestimated the time it may take to complete. Non the less, I will continue to work on it. I have left comments in certain places for your perusal. This is simply just to prove to you that I know what it does.

There are 3 project folders:

# DataLibrary - This is the API
The API takes the model created by the MVC form and creates the SQL query and sends it to the database. I used Dapper, System.Configuration ans System.Data.SqlClient to assist me.

# TechnicalTest - This is the ASP.NET MVC 5 using the Entity Framework
This was the biggest learning curve I had. But I had a lot of fun learning about it. A lot of aspects of MVC made a lot of sense to me.

# TechnicalTestDB - This is the Visual Studio SQL Database
I have made and used databases before. I have previously created a localDB and used it. But I haven't come across the same issue I ran into in this project. Unfortunately this has been the biggest road block for me. I had published a database model to my localDB and was ready to use it, until I had a change of heart about the design. So I changed the tables layout and tried to re-publish the model to my localDB. But I received an error telling me it was unable to import batch. I understood that this was because there was a DB already in my localDB with the same name. So I deleted it. and tried again but the error still persisted. and even the old DB model was unretrievable. I will am still going to try to solve this issue so I can continue implementing the rest of the project.
